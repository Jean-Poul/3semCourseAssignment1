## Daily Log:
### **Monday**
- Introduction from teacher to Course Assigment 1.
- Initial setup:
  - Github repository

  - Trying to setup access to droplet for everyone.  
    Not solved that day due to public keys denied for everyone except droplet owner.
      
### **Tuesday**
- Making sure everybody has a working start project and are able to push to github and deploy through travis. Which was more difficult then it sounds because of issues with travis not deplying and the project not building for everyone in the group. Eventually it worked out.

  - joke entity
  - jokes DTO
